# Travel Setup Guide

Welcome to Travel, your one-stop solution for student housing management! This guide will help you set up and deploy your Travel website on your web server. Follow the instructions below for a seamless experience.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, the provided GitHub repository containing all the necessary code and files for your website:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekranjan45/TravelProject.git
cd TravelProject
```

## Step 2: Project Structure

In this project, you will find the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for your website.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file for your website.
- `style.css`: The main CSS file for your website.

## Step 3: Initial Commit

Ensure that you have committed your initial files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Step 4: Deploy the Website

1. **Install Dependencies:** If your project has any dependencies, make sure to install them. For example, if you use npm, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Serve the Application:** Serve the application using your web server or a development server. For a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, you can use a simple HTTP server like `http-server`:

   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Access the Website:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by your server, typically `http://localhost:8080` or a similar address.

## Additional Steps

- **Configure Environment Variables:** If your project requires environment variables, ensure they are set up correctly. Create a `.env` file and update it with your configurations.

- **Set Up Cron Jobs:** If your application requires scheduled tasks, set up cron jobs on your server to ensure they run as expected.

- **Secure Your Application:** Implement necessary security measures such as HTTPS, firewall configurations, and regular backups.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll have your Travel website up and running smoothly. For further assistance or issues, refer to the project's documentation or contact our support team.
